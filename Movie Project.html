<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p> One of the best movies to come out of the 2020s, this movie was definitely a movie made with a comedic stance <br>
    and a strong, serious tone towards the movie. Broke a lot of traditions and created one of the best movies that <br>
    that fully immerses you, the audience into the experience,
     but drops a cliffhanger and then makes you want to watch its sequel.
